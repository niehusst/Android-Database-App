# Android Database Application

An Android application that gets and holds information about all past and present members of Grinnell Appdev by asynchronously scraping data from a JSON file.

## Tools

* [Android Studio] I used Android Studio to create this app

## Operation Notes

* The app is designed to function for sdk 15 through sdk 27

* The url from which this app scrapes information from is only accessible on the Grinnell College campus, and may be subject to change (or disappear) due to it being owned by a member of the class of 2018.
